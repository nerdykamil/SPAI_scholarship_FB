- We will query our database and evaluate whether the result is leaking private information
- this would be when the output of the query changes when you remove somone from the database

Sensitivity: (or L1 Sensitivity)
The max amount a query changes when removing an individual from the database is called sensitivity

- it is usually easier to protect privacy when the information to the query is controbuted from multiple people and not just one individual

- sensitivity can be fixed or varaible across multiple databases where each database corresponds to a view where a person has been removed

- Differential privacy: when the privacy of a person is compromised by doing a reverse query on the data with and without that person and noting the result
