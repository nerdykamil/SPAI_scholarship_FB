Trusted Aggregator
- a trusted party who we can trust to not see the the gradients when performing the aggregation.

Additive Secret Sharing - a form of cryptography
- aggregating gradients in an encrypted state rather than trusting a third party with it
- it is a simple technique which allows individuals to add the numbers together without one person learning the inputs of others

Fixed Precision Encoding
- used for decimal numbers as the above method deals with integers only

The above two methods of encoding have been properly implemented in pysyft with proper methods and functions. (See Section3 securing Federated Learning for this)
